things i'll probably need
move_towards_point
distance_to_point
setting the "speed"?

there's also the "direction" property

I could use this create event to set to the speed 
this is in "pixels per step"
60 steps per second
lets just try speed at 60 then
then since 0 degrees is right, set direction to 180
should probably set a starting x and y first though
