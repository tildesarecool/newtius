My horizontal space shooter made in GMS2. (working title).

Tutorials/guides I'm using as reference (partially from my own projects and partially as documented)

 - [Fire Jump DND edition](https://www.yoyogames.com/en/tutorials/fire-jump-dnd-1)
 - [GML edition of space rocks written edition](https://www.yoyogames.com/en/tutorials/space-rocks-gml)

I have what I'll loosely call a dev log on this game and other programming adventures [on my blog under the dev log category](https://tildesare.cool/category/programming/dev-log/). The first entry mentioning this game is still a work in progress (but coming soon).

I'm at an extremely early stage of for this game right now. In fact a sprite that can move in at least four directions and fire a projectile would be a nice bench mark to work towards.

As soon as I accomplish that I'll put a page together on itch.io because *why not?*
