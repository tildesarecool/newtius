## Newtius

My horizontal space shooter made in GMS2. (working title).  

Tutorials/guides I'm using as reference (partially from my own projects and partially as documented)


-  [Fire Jump DND edition](https://www.yoyogames.com/en/tutorials/fire-jump-dnd-1)
-  [GML edition of space rocks written edition](https://www.yoyogames.com/en/tutorials/space-rocks-gml)

I have what I'll loosely call a dev log on this game and other programming adventures [on my blog under the dev log category](https://tildesare.cool/category/programming/dev-log/). The first entry mentioning this game is still a work in progress (but coming soon).
  

I'm at an extremely early stage of for this game right now. In fact a sprite that can move in at least four directions and fire a projectile would be a nice bench mark to work towards.

As soon as I accomplish that I'll put a page together on itch.io because *why not?*

## Updates!

**18th January 2022**

No updates. Well I created a blog post (see my blog link above). But no functional changes yet. I wanted to document some things before moving on.

## References

- My repo for that time I followed along [with creating Breakout](https://github.com/tildesarecool/Breakout-GMS2-followalong) - in GML.
- My [DND edition firejump repo](https://github.com/tildesarecool/FireJumpGMS2). Still good for reference even if it's not GML.
- My repo for a [Udemy course on GMS2 using entirely GML](https://github.com/tildesarecool/Programming-in-GameMaker-Studio-2-udemy-course). A very basic interactive "game" but good on fundamentals.
- My [repo for the "space rocks" youtube tutorial I followed](https://github.com/tildesarecool/grad-dah-clone-gamemaker-ed), DND edition. Again, still a good reference.
